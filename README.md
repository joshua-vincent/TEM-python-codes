# TEM-python-codes
This repository houses (mostly) Python-based scripts that I developed during my PhD at Arizona State University.

Most of the scripts are involved in mutlislice TEM image simulation and image processing. 
Some others I used to generate atomistic models for the purpose of then simulating TEM images.
